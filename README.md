# Computer-Graphics
Some of my Processing/P.js/p5js sketches and computer graphics experiments (software rendering mostly)

`NoCode` directory contain images / videos produced with variant OR unreleased / lost code

`opexport` contain a full export (most recent but with no data) of all my Open Processing sketches, there may be some old duplicate / old versions of it in `p5js` or `P.js` directories containing data.

Complete screenshot previews of all sketches (captured from Open Processing; see below) : screenshot.jpg

`opexport.py` is an Open Processing sketches exporter, it only work for single file sketches and does not import data, it use Python 3 / Selenium / Chromedriver to crawl sketches and save source code.

Images can be found on [my website](https://www.onirom.fr)
